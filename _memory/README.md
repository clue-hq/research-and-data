# Project Memory

This directory is the durable collaboration log for agents working on this repository.

At the start of each session:

1. Read this file.
2. Read the newest session note(s).
3. Read any topic note that matches the current task.
4. Verify memory-derived facts against the current workspace before editing.

During and at the end of each coding or goal session, update `_memory/` with:

- progress made;
- files changed;
- decisions and accepted assumptions;
- failures, blocked attempts, or commands/tests that did not work;
- verification performed;
- unresolved follow-ups.

Keep notes concise and operational. Do not store secrets, API keys, credentials, customer data, or raw proprietary source excerpts here.

## Repository Role

This repository is the data and research subsystem for the larger AI-native ABM orchestration platform. Its job is to turn client ICPs and client knowledge into canonical account/contact entities, typed claims with provenance, explainable fit/intent scores, and persona-keyed buying-committee research that downstream content and design systems can trust.

The central architecture bet is that verification must be modeled at the claim/data layer. LLM research is a last-resort tier-4 source, not the foundation. The product should prefer empty, flagged fields over fabricated fields.
