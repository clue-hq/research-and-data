Conventions every migration must honour (docs/specs/M00-foundations-and-shared-contracts.md §M0.3;
see src/clue_research/db/README.md "Migration conventions checklist"):
- Append-only: claim history supersedes via ``superseded_by``; never UPDATE a value column in place.
- UTC ``timestamptz`` for time columns (e.g. ``observed_at`` / ``collected_at``).
- JSONB ``value_json`` payloads, with real indexed columns on the hot query keys (``entity_id`` …).
- Everything keys on a resolved ``entity_id`` — never a free-text name.
- Forward + reverse: ``downgrade()`` must cleanly reverse ``upgrade()`` (CI runs up → down → up).
